# Zterm
Zterm is a simple terminal emulator using Vte and Gtk+ writting using the
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language. Currently basic functionality
works including opening and closing terminals in tabs and panes, giving it a
program to run on the command line and setting the title from the command line.
In the future, Zterm will have a configuration framework that allows setting
things like colors, scrollback buffer lines and the terminal font.
